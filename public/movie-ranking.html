<h3>Hunt for the Wilderpeople</h3>
<p>This movie always cracks me up. It never ceases to amuse me and make me cry. It's so wholesome</p>
<h3>The Phantom of the Opera</h3>
<p>I first saw this movie when I was 10. It has been one of my favorites ever since. The music is stunning and the vocals from Emmy Rossum made me want to learn to sing.</p>
