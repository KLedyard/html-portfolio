<h1>About Me</h1>
<hr>
<p>I grew up in Sacramento, CA and moved to Utah with my family when I was 18 years old. I have four sisters 
  and am the second child. I was homeschooled and loved getting to learn new things.
</p>

<p>I met my husband at 20 and we quickly fell in love and got married the following year. We've been married for 
  five and a half years. We now have two dogs. Padme, a Miniature Australian Shepherd and Eva, a Cavlier King 
  Charles Spaniel. We moved to Raleigh North Carolina in 2023 and have loved living here!
</p>

<p>I started my journey into web development in the past few weeks and have loved it so far! I'm excited to continue to learn 
  and to hopefully find a career in this profession.
